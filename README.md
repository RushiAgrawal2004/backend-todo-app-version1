📝 Project Overview
I built the Backend Todo App to practice and implement core backend development skills. This project showcases my ability to:

🔐 Implement JWT-based authentication to securely manage user sessions.

🔄 Perform complete CRUD operations on todo items.

🛡️ Apply basic backend security practices, including password hashing with bcryptjs.

🗂️ Design and integrate a relational SQLite database using better-sqlite3.

🌐 Develop and structure RESTful APIs using Node.js and Express.js.

This app allows users to register, log in, and manage their own personalized todo list. I’ve focused on writing clean, secure, and modular backend code that could easily be expanded into a full-stack application.
